            VTU SGPA and CGPA calculator is a tool designed to easily calculate sgpa
            and cgpa. All you need to do is enter your marks that you have got for the 
            semester you want to calculate when it comes to SGPA. I will try to add more
             features and keep this site updated. If this website has helped you, consider
              recommending it to your friends.

              The story of how this page was created is simple: when I went to class one morning 
              after VTU had released the results, the guy sitting behind me was complaining that 
              he could not calculate his GPA as he did not know how the calculation was done. He
               said the credits varied from subject to subject. He also proudly stated he was too
                lazy to do it. He complained through the entire class. I made this site to stop
                 him from complaining.
