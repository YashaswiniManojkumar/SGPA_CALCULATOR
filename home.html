        between universities and the boards. It is important for students to know the method of <br>
        calculation conducted and general knowledge of the terms used. Students who have cleared <br>
        their class 12, and are applying to various courses in Colleges and Universities, should <br>
        be aware of the meaning of the terms like CGPA and SGPA and the difference between them, <br>
        as both terms will be used in their graduation and further higher studies, after 12th. The<br>

        CGPA Vs SGPA: Defining CGPA and SGPA<br>


Semester Grade Point Average or SGPA, is an average grade point that is calculated at the end <br>
of an academic session like a semester at college. The formula for calculation of SGPA is the <br>
sum of all the credit points awarded for the subjects divided by total credits allotted to that<br>
semester. Whereas, Cumulative Grade Point Average or CGPA is used to measure the overall studentâ€™s<br>
academic performance of the students in school and colleges. The formula for calculation of CGPA<br>
is Sum of total SGPA in all semesters divided by total number of credit hours. Another difference<br>
between both is, SGPA is for a shorter period of time and CGPA is for a longer period of time.
